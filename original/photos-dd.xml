            <description>A brief descriptive phrase that includes these elements, generally in this order: who, what, where, when. The Title is a concise sentence which will be used to label the thumbnails; it will also be the first line of the descriptive information. The Title may be the caption assigned by the photographer or the collector, or it may be created by Special Collections staff from the given caption and from additional sources. In the absence of any caption, the Title will be provided by Special Collections staff.&lt;p>If the caption provided by the photographer is adequate, place it in theTitle field. Then, the Notes field should include this phrase: Title taken from photograph. If the caption provided by the photographer is inadequate, a created title should be placed in the Title field; the Notesfield should then read: Caption on image: "Image title."&lt;p>If there is a series caption, it should be added, in the Notes field, in sequence after the title on the
                image: Caption on image: "Image title"; "Series title." There should also be a separate notation in the Notes field in the form: Part of Hegg series entitled: "Series title."</description>

            <marcNotes>Maps to the title statement (245); a 245$h is automatically added by the DCG to complete the 245 field. Indicators are set manually to 00 for MARC 245; we expect this shouldn't cause too much trouble, as photograph titles generally do not start with nonfiling characters. Formerly we mapped also to 520_8#_$a, "Summary," which has been removed.</marcNotes>

            <marcNotes>Subjects (LCTGM) are mapped to 653 "Index Term--Uncontrolled." The DCG allows us to assign it to 650$a with $2=aat (if we add that "aat" as a DCG "suffix") based on unpredictable positions (or quantities) of TGM subject headings. We cannot predict those positions/quantities so we are stuck with MARC 653. Here are some more observations/questions: (1) The subjects properties in FERA are cdm controlled vovabularies; multiple headings are separated by semi-colon; it appears the DCG recognized this and splits all values to create repeating MARC 653 fields. (2) Why does the DCG distinguish Subjects (LCTGM)from Subjects (LCSH) using dc:subject:[integer denoting position] for the former, subject:[integer denoting position] for the latter (that is, lacking the "dc:" prefix)? Why the former is prefixed dc: is not clear, as both are mapped to dc. (3) The DCG allows us to add prefix/suffix to values of dc properties, not distinguishing between "dc:subject" and plain "subject;" in our case that means whatever is appended to Subjects (LCTGM) must also be appended to Subjects (LCSH), further prohibing us from using MARC 650 even it was available (as LCSH would be 650_#0_$a[subject], LCTGM would be 650_#7$a[subject]$2aat.</marcNotes>

            <description>Denotes genre or type of material. If more than one term is applicable, list the form of the item scanned first.

            <marcNotes>Maps to MARC 655 "Index Term--Genre/Form." Photograph collections are expected to use TGM for sources of headings, and a more accurate mapping would be 655_#7_$a [henre/form term] $2 gmgpc. In FERA however there are two values for this property, one (image) that does not appear to be in the TGM. The second Object Type in FERA, Photograph, is a change from the actual thesaurus entry, Photographs. Finally, for some reason, the DCG drops the second FERA heading, image, so we can't map that anyway. All put together, it seemed best to make indicator 2 = 4 "source not specified."</marcNotes>

(Note: MARC 776 not availabvle in DCG; MARC 530 is available to the DCG.) Alternatively the record can describe the priginal, with a MARC 533 "Reproduction Note" decribing the digital image. Another option: MARC 534 "Original Version Note" -- but that is not an option using the DCG.</marcNotes>
