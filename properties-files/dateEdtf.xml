            <para>EDTF is still a standard in progress. It has not yet been accpted as a full recommendation. It should be voted on in 2018 by ISO. We are anticipating it will becoming a 2-part ISO 8601-2018.</para>
            <para>This document needs a reference to the spec.</para>
            <para>For the xsd, datatype is xs:string; the datatype is more accurately http://id.loc.gov/datatypes/edtf, which is not a valid QName and is inavlid according to schema-4-properties-0.1, but this does not seem to be machine-actionable; more exploration needed.</para>

        <changeLog>
            <change/>
            <change date="2017-10-23">changed //cdm/required to //cdm/cdmRequired and //cdm/uwRequired to assist in halting use of the cdm "required" feature while, at the same time, indicating that UW-cdm collections must use, or not use, a given property; also changed @xsi:schemaLocation. Also updated link to EDTF and added some instructions.</change>
