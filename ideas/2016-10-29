how to proceed

1. produce property files for photo colls
handed of to L Wainer; TG will review her work in December.

1a. validate all property files with schemas-4-properties.xsd

*1b. write property2html xslt for easy property viewing
This is a good idea. It could also be done in the form.

1c. Revise XForm for entering property data.


2. write photoColl dd using xinclude as a “pilot”
Write DDs (with XInclude) for 5 specific collections guided by the photoColl DD.

2a. verify all dds using schema-4-dds.xsd


3. re-write dds-to-html.xsl


4. produce photoColl and The5 dd as html

4a. figure out how to post on MIG web site 

Concern: there will be edits needed for DDs; do they take place at the properties.xml file? At the DD.xml file? At the HTML version? Is so, there needs to be tight version control. Retstated: we need to accommodate customizations consistently and predictably. 


5. edit xsl for xml schema for photoColl and The5


6. produce xsd for photoColl and The5.

6a. clean metadata for The5.
Likely needs to be coordinated with AG.
INVESTIGATE CATCHER?

6b. export metadata for The5. Clean until valid.


7. Map to DCG — in the property.xml files?

7a. upload to OCLC.


8 RDFS/ontology for The5.

8a. write XSLT 4 RDF.
use sameAs in property.xml files. Anything else?
Do we need to mint URIs?
Not every property maps to DC; what do we do for those as RDF?
Should we have a “custom” RDF, a DC RDF, both, or a mixture?

8b. Produce RDF and store in triplestore.


9. all resources/md should be somehow posted/announced on cams web site
  

OVERALL CONcERN 1: we can build stuff from 2 sources: the property.xml files or the DDs; the former are not collection-specific; the latter are collection specific.



OVERALL CONCERN 2: how could this go to "pre-production?"
xforms/xquery for properties: 
search current properties for appropriate property.
search using html versions of property files?
validate in form?
