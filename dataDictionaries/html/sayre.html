               </p>
               <p>The Title is a concise sentence which will be used to label the thumbnails in CONTENTdm;
                  it will also be the first line of the descriptive information. The Title may be the
                  caption assigned by the photographer or the collector, or it may be created by Special
                  Collections staff from the given caption and from additional sources. In the absence
                  of any caption, the Title will be provided by Special Collections staff.
               </p>
               <p>If the caption provided by the photographer is adequate, place it in the Title field.
                  Then, the Notes field should include this phrase: Title taken from photograph.
               </p>
               <p>If the caption provided by the photographer is inadequate, a created title should
                  be placed in the Title field; the Notes field should then read: Caption on image:
                  "Image title."
               </p>
               <p>If there is a series caption, it should be added, in the Notes field, in sequence
                  after the title on the image: Caption on image: "Image title"; "Series title." There
                  should also be a separate notation in the Notes field in the form: Part of Hegg series
                  entitled: "Series title."

               <p>"Notes" is distingushed from "Historical Notes" mainly because it descibes the image/resource

                  precisely descibe the image/resource. "HistoricalNotes" are more like "writing" and
